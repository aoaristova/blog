# Let's tell about report! üìù

***Every week*** we do laboratory work. Then we should prepare a report on our labs. We perform reports for laboratory work in the lightweight markup language **markdown**.

# What is MARKDOWN? ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

# How do we execute the report? üíª

For each laboratory work, we have a *template* that we need to fill in with all the necessary information.

The title page of the report contains information about the *number* of the lab, the *topic* and the *author* of the report.
Next, we describe the *purpose* of the laboratory work, the *task*, as well as a *theoretical introduction*. 

And then the description of the main part of the work begins. ***Description of the work.*** 

We should describe the accomplishment of the work as *fully and clearly* as possible.

To do this, we can divide the job description into several parts, insert screenshots, etc.

# For what? ü§î ‚ùì üí°

Creating a report is an **important stage** of laboratory work, because it is during the execution of the report that the material is consolidated and its full awareness occurs.
