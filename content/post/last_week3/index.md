Every week I make a wish that I will spend the next week more productively and interestingly. Surely, you have already noticed this in my regular posts.

As for this week, it's hard to say whether it worked out this time.

On the one hand üêá, I did not make much progress in my studies this week, although I still answered in class and did all my homework.

On the other hand üê§, I was able to achieve the goal that I set myself a week ago. I met and talked with friends. We discussed various topics, inflated balloons and walked around.

Spring is in full swing üçÉ and summer is just around the corner ‚õ±Ô∏è! I think many of you are tired, as am I. I assure you that very soon we will be able to relax and take care of ourselves and loved ones. But it takes a little more effort.

Thank you for your attention.

With best wishes, Arina.
