Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

# Basic information about Markdown:

To create a title, use the sign ( # ), for example, look above! Do you see big text? It is the title!

To make the text **bold**, enclose it in double asterisks.

To set an *italic* font for the text, enclose it in single asterisks.

To set ***bold and italicized*** text, enclose it in triple
asterisks.

The bulleted list can be formatted using asterisks or dashes:
- yes.
- it is a fact.

The ordered list can be formatted using the appropriate numbers:
1. Don’t you believe me?
2. See for yourself.

# Conclusion:

Implementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen programming languages; in addition, many platforms and frameworks support Markdown. For example, Markdown plugins exist for every major blogging platform.
