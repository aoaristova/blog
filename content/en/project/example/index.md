# Let‚Äôs talk about Intel! üñ•Ô∏è

For sure, many people know the prototype of the emergence of successful technology firms: a modest beginning, a struggle with circumstances, outsider founders and more. For example, it is enough to recall Bill Gates with Microsoft or Steve Jobs with Apple, who started their activities literally in basements or garages. But Intel was created differently. 

The founders of the company were not young ambitious rebels, but respectable men who had a solid reputation in the industry at that time. Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce did not need to look for money for years to launch the enterprise, instead they collected $ 2.3 million in half a day. Soon they were joined as a co-founder by Andrew Grove, who for many years became the head of production at Intel. And although Robert Noyce himself often called the company a "three‚Äìheaded monster," in fact, another person was present during its creation - marketing star Bob Graham.

# What seems to me important and interesting in the structure of the company. üñ•  

At that time, all technology companies had a clearly established "vertical of power", that is, each employee could interact only with his immediate superior and those who are below him in this structure. No other way. However, Noyce and Moore wanted everyone who has interesting ideas not to be afraid to express them, and everyone who has a question to ask it. Thus, no one (even the founders) could refuse to help or answer someone's question. Even meetings at Intel were held in, so to speak, in an "open" format, that is, anyone who thought they could be useful at this meeting could attend it. 

# What's it? Is it a revolution or just a stage in the industry that no one will notice? üíª

When the company was particularly in need of orders, an offer was received for the design and production of a circuit of eight logic chips designed specifically for the customer's calculator, however, due to certain circumstances, another decision was made ‚Äì to assemble a miniature household computer and program it to perform arithmetic operations for the customer's calculator. As a result, having lost a significant part of the profit, as a result of the revision of the license agreement, Intel gets the rights to sell the design to other consumers. It was this decision that allowed Intel to become the company it is. However, the 4004 (the first microprocessor based on this chip), although it was an innovation, did not have the opportunity to take a place "inside real computers", since it could process only 4 bits of information at the same time. 

Subsequently, Intel has already released an eight-bit 8008, which in many respects corresponded, but also in many ways inferior to the 4004.

In 1978, it appeared, the first hexadecimal 8086 processor, it was backward compatible with the previous model, which allowed using the texts of already written programs.  Then the 8088 also appears, built on the basis of the 8086, half of the address bus was disabled, and it was limited to performing eight-bit operations, but it was significantly faster than previous eight-bit developments. 

The x86 architecture became the industry standard, in 1982 the 80186 and 80286 were released. Reducing the number of individual chips and simultaneously increasing the number of functions of the processor itself made it possible to make processors more productive, and the system simpler and cheaper.

The first 32-bit i386 processor (80386) was released in 1985, which also retained backward compatibility with 8086 and 80286. i486 was released in 1989, contained more than a million (1.2 million) transistors, and worked twice as fast as 80386. 

At that time, computer buyers paid attention only to the brand of the PC itself, and did not attach any importance to what kind of processor was inside. Therefore, in order to show users that the main part of the computer is the processor, and it should serve as the basis for choosing a PC, Intel decides on an unusual step ‚Äì the "Intel Inside" advertising campaign.

In 1993, the Pentium appeared. And, it would seem, Intel is ahead of everyone again, but no! 

Everything is going well until an unknown professor Thomas Knisley decides to divide one number by another. And here's the bad luck! Gets an incorrect result, and realizes that this is an error in the processor. The scandal is growing at an incredible rate. 

Pentium Pro appeared as a "replacement" for Pentium, but eventually becomes more of a processor for servers and workstations. 

In 1997, the real replacement for the Pentium was the Pentium II.

In the first versions of the Pentium III there were slightly less than 10 million transistors, and already another model (one of the last) contains about 44 million.

The Pentium 4 barely overtook its predecessor. 

Pentium M is an exceptional architecture for laptops. 

In recent years, Intel's main goal has been to reduce power consumption and, as a result, reduce temperature, new processors do not differ as much in performance from previous ones as before. 

Intel, created more than half a century ago, was different from other companies in the industry from the very moment of its creation, and even then it was not difficult to predict its success. However, no one could have imagined such a triumph, for sure. 

Almost from the very beginning of the company's work, the most interesting history of the emergence and development of microprocessors originates. It is unknown what the industry would be like now if it were not for a number of decisions made by the founders and heads of the corporation, as well as the long-term work of brilliant engineers from Intel, whose developments served as the foundation of the technological revolution of the XX century. Today Intel can rightfully be called the largest and most famous corporation for the production of microprocessors.
