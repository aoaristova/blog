The study is finally ending. This is the last post about the past week this year. 

It was an interesting adventure. A lot has been done, created and studied this year. 

I've done a lot of work this week. I have completed the last laboratory work in this discipline. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to meet my friends again, but I had to be patient a little bit, and it will happen more often! 

Very soon we will go on a well-deserved vacation! It's been a busy and interesting year, but we're all tired. And this means that we need to rest! 

With best wishes! ðŸ’–

See you soon! ðŸ’–
