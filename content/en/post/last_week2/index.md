Two weeks ago, I decided to spend the next week better than the previous one. And a week ago I promised that this week would be more colorful and productive...🥀💮🌼

# But did I manage to keep my promise?

I **didn't waste any time** this week again. I studied a lot 📚, did all the tasks 🖋️, read 📖, watched TV shows 📺. But unfortunately, I didn't even get to meet my friends this week 😭. 

# In this case, is it possible to call this week productive? 🤔

It seems to me that it is **very important** to find time for rest and communication. And I didn't succeed. I hope I won't make this mistake again.

# Will the next week more productive?!

Moreover, I'm not sure I can be more productive next week, so I won't promise it this time. However, I can promise myself to **try to do everything I need** next week.


Thank you for your attention! See you soon!
