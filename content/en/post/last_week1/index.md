# Has this week been productive?

A week ago, I promised myself that I would spend this week **even more productively** than last week. I hope I managed to do it.

This week I was still very busy studying. I did a lot of homework ðŸ“–, worked in classes at the university ðŸ“š, studied additional material ðŸ’».

Of course I **did not forget about the rest**. I managed to watch a couple of episodes of my favorite TV show ðŸŽ¬, read a little ðŸ“š and meet with friends ðŸŽ‰. 

However, this **was not enough for me to feel good**, this week I felt very **stressed** and **tired**. Therefore, I hope that next week I will be able to distribute time both to study and to rest in order to feel better. 

# In general, 
spring has finally come! ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒºðŸŒž We should leave the house more often and go out with our loved ones. But we can do this only after all the cases are finished.

That is why I **hope** that next week will be no less **productive** and **interesting**.
